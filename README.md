# Jewish-Interest MCP Projects

  This repository is a very small collection of MCP servers that was collated on April 6, 2025. Hopefully the diversity of MCP servers will only continue to increase and I may be able to update this at a point in time in the future. For now, these projects might be of interest to Jewish users.

## What is MCP?

The Model Control Protocol (MCP) is a standard that allows large language models (LLMs) to interact with external tools and data sources. This enables LLMs to access real-time information, perform specialized tasks, and work with domain-specific knowledge that may not be included in their training data.
